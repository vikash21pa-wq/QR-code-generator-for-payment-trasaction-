Project Title: UPI Payment QR Code Generator
🔹 Technology Used: Python

I built a QR Code Generator application that converts a UPI ID into a payment-ready QR code. The system formats the UPI payment URL and generates a scannable QR code that can be used for direct digital payments.

💡 Problem Solved:
Many small businesses struggle to quickly create custom UPI QR codes for receiving payments. This tool simplifies the process by generating QR codes instantly.
